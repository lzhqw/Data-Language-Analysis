abstract="Crowdfunding represents a rather novel alternative of funding new ventures, and has gained increased attention during recent years. However, a distinct positioning of crowdfunding within the range of alternative financial methods and a systematization and preparation of complex decision-structures of the crowdfunding concept in terms of decision making aspects has remained largely unexplored. This research (i) gives a well-defined classification of crowdfunding compared to other financing methods and (ii) provides a clear picture of decision-making steps within the triadic relationship of involved actors.",

We draw from two fields of financing adjacent to equity crowdfunding, venture capital (VC) and angel investing, as well as rewards-based crowdfunding, to develop an understanding of the drivers of investment decisions in equity crowdfunding. Using data from a leading equity crowdfunding platform in Northern Europe, we explore factors that drive the number of investors and amount of funding attracted by equity crowdfunding campaigns. The results suggest that the investment decision criteria traditionally used by VCs or business angels are not of prime importance for success in equity crowdfunding. Instead, success is related to pre-selected crowdfunding campaign characteristics and the utilization of private and public networks. The findings are relevant for the decision making of entrepreneurs and crowdfunding platforms, as both parties benefit from campaign success.}

abstract = {How does an entrepreneur's social network impact crowdfunding? Based on social capital theory, we developed a research model and conducted a comparative study using objective data collected from China and the U.S. We found that an entrepreneur's social network ties, obligations to fund other entrepreneurs, and the shared meaning of the crowdfunding project between the entrepreneur and the sponsors had significant effects on crowdfunding performance in both China and the U.S. The predictive power of the three dimensions of social capital was stronger in China than it was in the U.S. Obligation also had a greater impact in China.}

abstract = {Abstract Reward-based crowdfunding campaigns are commonly offered in one of two models via fundraising goals set by an entrepreneur: “Keep-It-All” (KIA), where the entrepreneur keeps the entire amount raised regardless of achieving the goal, and “All-Or-Nothing” (AON), where the entrepreneur keeps nothing unless the goal is achieved. We hypothesize that AON forces the entrepreneur to bear greater risk and encourages crowdfunders to pledge more capital enabling entrepreneurs to set larger goals. We further hypothesize that AON is a costly signal of commitment for entrepreneurs yielding a separate equilibrium with higher quality and more innovative projects with greater success rates. Empirical tests support both hypotheses.},
